# How to Create a Date Table using R

In this repository you will find a R script that generates a "date" table based on a start date and end date. I created this script to generate a date table in Microsoft's Power BI. If you have questions please contact me at rwade@dieselanalytics.com and I will do my best to answer them.

FYI, I am having trouble with the "Quarter Day" field. for some reason it returns seconds and not the day. I am investigating this problem. If you know how to correct it then please submit a pull request with the solution. Thanks!
